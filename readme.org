web-based 3D tool that ingests LiDAR point cloud files, and allows users to draw
cuboids around objects within those point clouds. 
Agents will be able to navigate around clouds (rotate, pan, zoom) 
and assign labels to the cuboids they make.

need:
- [x] draw point cloud
- [x] draw cuboid 
- [x] read json
- [x] export json
- [ ] read lidar file
